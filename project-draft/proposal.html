        <p>Elsword is a 2007 side-scroller Korean MMO video game developed by KOG. Now past the peak of its popularity, its active playerbase has significantly dwindled within the past decade with mainly loyal long-time (and reluctant) fans making up the majority of both the global and South Korean communities.</p>
        <p>In the course of recent years, however, the service has experienced many changes to its core gameplay loop, garnering various polarizing opinions and reactions. While the advent of new quality of life features and adjustments to better integrate new and existing players into the midgame scene has allowed the game to see more activity, within the small number of players whose attentions it has managed to maintain, closure of the official forums and migration to Discords for information has done little to amend impressions or guide players through making informed choices. The popular notion that the game is pay to win— which is certainly true to an extent— due to said information deficiency often misleads and pressures users into making damaging (whether financial, timely, or account-bricking) decisions about how they should progress, much less interact with other players.</p>
        <p>It’s thus no surprise that within the small playerbase are an even smaller amount of resources with the most prominent, Elwiki, being mainly a database. What resources already exist may also be anything between overwhelming (KnifeTricks' progression guide), difficult to find unless directly shared (crit/maxi stats and buff/debuff spreadsheets), or unintuitive (tutorials/encounter guides). These frictions are oftentimes a result of the mechanisms in the game being extremely confusing and flawed themselves. The problem I'd like to outline here is not so much for the sake of promoting or revitalizing the game, but rather to point towards how this lack of clarity has been an active, tangible detriment to the ways users engage with the service as a whole.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>In order to address this dilemma, the web app this project intends to design hopes to target the concerns most commonly identified amongst <strong>casual players</strong> lingering in the early and mid-game stages of the game, making up the majority of the populace. It would deviate away from being strictly a database to instead share player-oriented knowledge and contextualize the core mechanics of the game, pertaining to character synergies, encounter needs, and techniques to progress entirely <em>without</em> the need to pay.</p>
        <p>Like so, it highlights the following features for the scope of this course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>quiz</strong> to help users decide what classes they’d like to play in the game, aiming to streamline the experience of going through and remembering what all 60 characters do, as well as what roles they fulfill.</li>
            <li>A <strong>party builder</strong> that allows users to slot in different characters and display the buff/debuffs they have access to, as well as what they’d still need (ex. Every party should have a healer, sometimes two if the dedicated damage dealers are particularly resource dependent) based on a given encounter.</li>
            <li>A simplified <strong>progression checklist</strong>. Users will be able to sign up and login in order to record and manage information about what they currently have (whether it’s gear milestones, account-wide passives, etc.) or still need to help provide specific direction and guidance on what they should do next.
                <ul>
                    <li>This would be depicted as an organized list of 'quests' a newbie or midgame player should focus on and complete to help engage with the systems at a steady and manageable pace</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some <strong>extra insights</strong> to keep in mind for development also include information and interactions pertaining to character hotbar/setup recommendations, stat spreads and how to reach certain thresholds, future events to look out for, and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ideally, the web app would adequately implement these and even more in future developments to better accommodate the information needs of users as the game continues to dynamically change new player experiences.</p>
